@article{Aguirre2013Adaptive,
	Abstract = {Many-objective problems are becoming common in several real-world application domains and there is a growing interest to develop evolutionary many-objective optimizers that can solve them effectively. Studies on selection for many-objective optimization and most recently studies on the characteristics of many-objective landscapes, the effectiveness of operators of variation, and the effects of large populations have proved successful to advance our understanding of evolutionary many-objective optimization. This work proposes an evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm that uses adaptive ε-dominance principles to select survivors and also to create neighborhoods to bias mating, so that solutions will recombine with other solutions located close by in objective space. We investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm on DTLZ continuous problems, using a short number of generations to evolve the population, varying population size from 100 to 20000 individuals. Results show that the application of adaptive ε-dominance principles for survival selection as well as for mating selection improves considerably the performance of the optimizer.},

@article{Aguirre2014Distribution,
	Abstract = {This work studies distribution search in the context of evolutionary many-objective optimization where, in addition to good convergence towards the optimal Pareto front, it is required to find a set of trade-off solutions spread according to a given distribution. We particularly focus on the effectiveness of Adaptive ε-Ranking, which reclassifies sets of non-dominated solutions using iteratively a randomized sampling procedure that applies ε-dominance with a mapping function 
$$\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}){\mapsto }^{\epsilon }\mathbf{{f}}^{\prime}(\mathbf{x})$$
 to bias selection towards the distribution of solutions implicit in the mapping. We analyze the effectiveness of Adaptive ε-Ranking with three linear mapping functions for ε-dominance and study the importance of recombination to properly guide the algorithm towards the distribution we aim to find. As test problems, we use functions of the DTLZ family with M = 6 objectives, varying the number of variables N from 10 to 50.},

@article{Autuori2016,
	Abstract = {A mapping method (MaM) for a better solution space exploration adapted to NSGA-II method is presented. The Mapping technique divides the solution space into several zones using a Hamming distance to a reference solution. We present a bijective mapping function from the search space to the binary representation space of solutions. For each zone, a mapping metric is used to evaluate the solution space exploration. According to this evaluation, a local search is performed. The mapping is adapted to the well known non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) method applied to solve the flexible job shop problem (FJSP) case. We present the comparison between the hybridization using the local search for the non-dominated solutions and the hybridization using the mapping metrics. The multi-objective metrics show the efficiency of mapping adaptation in terms of convergence and diversity.},

The existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms that benefit from the multiple local searches (multiple-MOEAs, or MMOEAs) use different dividing methods and/or collaborations (information sharing) strategies between the created divisions. Their local evolutionary searches are implicitly or explicitly guided toward a part of global optimal solutions instead of converging to local ones in some divisions. In this reviewed paper, the dividing methods and the collaborations strategies are reviewed, while their advantage and disadvantage are mentioned.},

	Abstract = {Set-based evolutionary optimization based on the performance indicators is one of the effective methods to solve many-objective optimization problems; however, previous researches didn't make full use of the preference information of a high-dimensional objective space to guide the evolution of a population. In this study, we propose a set-based many-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm guided by preferred regions. In the mode of set-based evolution, the proposed method dynamically determines a preferred region of the high-dimensional objective space, designs a selection strategy on sets by combining Pareto dominance relation on sets with the above preferred region, and develops a crossover operator on sets guided by the above preferred region to produce a Pareto front with superior performance. The proposed method is applied to four benchmark many-objective optimization problems, and the experimental results empirically demonstrate its effectiveness.},

@article{Gong2015Setbased,
	Abstract = {Many-objective optimization problems are very common and important in real-world applications, and there exist few methods suitable for them. Therefore, many-objective optimization problems are focused on in this study, and a set-based genetic algorithm is presented to effectively solve them. First, each objective of the original optimization problem is transformed into a desirability function according to the preferred region defined by the decision-maker. Thereafter, the transformed problem is further converted to a bi-objective optimization one by taking hyper-volume and the decision-maker's satisfaction as the new objectives, and a set of solutions of the original optimization problem as the new decision variable. To tackle the converted bi-objective optimization problem using genetic algorithms, the crossover operator inside a set is designed based on the simplex method using solutions of the original optimization problem, and the crossover operator between sets is developed using the entropy of sets. In addition, the mutation operator of a set is presented to obey the Gaussian distribution and changes along with the decision-maker's preferences. The proposed method is tested on five benchmark many-objective optimization problems and compared with other six methods. The experimental results empirically demonstrate its effectiveness.},

@article{Guo2015Objective,
	Abstract = {In recent years, many-objective optimization problems (i.e. more than three objectives) have attracted the interests of many researchers. The main difficulties of many-objective optimization problems lie in high computational cost, stagnation in search process, etc. It is almost impossible to design an algorithm effective for all problems. However, for some problems, especially for problems with redundant objectives, it is possible to design effective algorithms by removing the redundant objectives and keeping the non-redundant objectives so that the original problem becomes the one with much fewer objectives. To do so, first, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm-based decomposition is adopted to generate a smaller number of representative non-dominated solutions widely distributed on the Pareto front. Then the conflicting objective pairs are identified through these non-dominated solutions, and the redundant objectives are determined by these pairs and then removed. Based on these, a fast non-redundant objectives generation algorithm is proposed in this paper. Finally, the experiments are conducted on a set of benchmark test problems and the results indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

@article{Ishibuchi2012Recombination,
	Abstract = {In the evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) community, indicator-based evolutionary algorithms (IBEAs) have rapidly increased their popularity in the last few years thanks to their theoretical background and high search ability. Hypervolume has often been used as an indicator to measure the quality of solution sets in IBEAs. It has been reported in the literature that IBEAs work well on a wide range of multiobjective problems including many-objective problems on which traditional Pareto dominance-based EMO algorithms such as NSGA-II and SPEA2 do not always work well. In this paper, we examine the behavior of SMS-EMOA, which is a frequently-used representative IBEA with a hypervolume indicator function, through computational experiments on many-objective 0/1 knapsack problems. We focus on the effect of two mating strategies on the performance of SMS-EMOA: One is to select extreme parents far from other solutions in the objective space, and the other is to recombine similar parents. Experimental results show that the recombination of similar parents improves the performance of SMS-EMOA on many-objective problems whereas the selection of extreme parents is effective only for a two-objective problem. For comparison, we also examine the effect of these mating strategies on the performance of NSGA-II.},

@article{Kim2005Variable,
	Abstract = {This article introduces variable chromosome lengths (VCL) in the context of a genetic algorithm (GA). This concept is applied to structural topology optimization but is also suitable to a broader class of design problems. In traditional genetic algorithms, the chromosome length is determined a priori when the phenotype is encoded into the corresponding genotype. Subsequently, the chromosome length does not change. This approach does not effectively solve problems with large numbers of design variables in complex design spaces such as those encountered in structural topology optimization. We propose an alternative approach based on a progressive refinement strategy, where a GA starts with a short chromosome and first finds an `optimum' solution in the simple design space. The `optimum' solutions are then transferred to the following stages with longer chromosomes, while maintaining diversity in the population. Progressively refined solutions are obtained in subsequent stages. A strain energy filter is used in order to filter out inefficiently used design cells such as protrusions or isolated islands. The variable chromosome length genetic algorithm (VCL-GA) is applied to two structural topology optimization problems: a short cantilever and a bridge problem. The performance of the method is compared to a brute-force approach GA, which operates ab initio at the highest level of resolution. },

	Abstract = {This work analyzes population size and neighborhood recombination in the context of many-objective optimization. Large populations might support better the evolutionary search to deal with the increased complexity inherent to high dimensional spaces, whereas neighborhood recombination can reduce dissimilarity between crossing individuals and would allow us to understand better the implications of a large number of solutions that are Pareto-optimal from the perspective of decision space and the operator of variation. Our aim is to understand why and how they improve the effectiveness of a dominance-based many-objective optimizer. To do that, we vary population size and analyze in detail convergence, front distribution, the distance between individuals that undergo crossover, and the distribution of solutions in objective space. We use DTLZ2 problem with m\UTF{2009}=\UTF{2009}5 objectives in our study, revealing important properties of large populations, recombination in general, and neighborhood recombination in particular, related to convergence and distribution of solutions.},

	Abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are increasingly being investigated to solve many-objective optimization problems. However, most algorithms recently proposed for many-objective optimization cannot find Pareto optimal solutions with good properties on convergence, spread, and distribution. Often, the algorithms favor one property at the expense of the other. In addition, in some applications it takes a very long time to evaluate solutions, which prohibits running the algorithm for a large number of generations. In this work to obtain good representations of the Pareto optimal set we investigate a large population MOEA, which employs adaptive ε-box dominance for selection and neighborhood recombination for variation, using a very short number of generations to evolve the population. We study the performance of the algorithm on some functions of the DTLZ family, showing the importance of using larger populations to search on many-objective problems and the effectiveness of employing adaptive ε-box dominance with neighborhood recombination that take into account the characteristics of many-objective landscapes.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we use an alternative preference relation that couples an achievement function and the ε-indicator in order to improve the scalability of a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (moea) in many-objective optimization problems. The resulting algorithm was assessed using the Deb-Thiele-Laumanns-Zitzler (dtlz) and the Walking- Fish-Group (wfg) test suites. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed approach has a good performance even when using a high number of objectives. Regarding the dtlz test problems, their main difficulty was found to lie on the presence of dominance resistant solutions. In contrast, the hardness of wfg problems was not found to be significantly increased by adding more objectives.},

	Abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are well-suited for solving several complex multi-objective problems with two or three objectives. However, as the number of conflicting objectives increases, the performance of most MOEAs is severely deteriorated. How to improve MOEAs' performance when solving many-objective problems, i.e. problems with four or more conflicting objectives, is an important issue since a large number of this type of problems exists in science and engineering; thus, several researchers have proposed different alternatives. This paper presents a review of the use of MOEAs in many-objective problems describing the evolution of the field, the methods that were developed, as well as the main findings and open questions that need to be answered in order to continue shaping the field.},

	Abstract = {MOEA/D is one of the promising evolutionary approaches for solving multi and many-objective optimization problems. MOEA/D decomposes a multi-objective optimization problem into a number of single objective optimization problems. Each single objective optimization problem is defined by a scalarizing function using a weight vector. In MOEA/D, there are several scalarizing approaches such as weighted Tchebycheff, reciprocal weighted Tchebycheff, weighted sum (WS) and penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI). Each scalarizing function has a characteristic effect on the search performance of MOEA/D and provides a scenario of multi-objective solution search. To improve the availability of MOEA/D framework for solving various kinds of problems, it is important to provide a new scalarizing function which has different characteristics from the conventional scalarizing functions. In particular, the conventional scalarizing approaches face a difficulty to approximate a widely spread Pareto front in some problems. To approximate the entire Pareto front by improving the spread of solutions in the objective space and enhance the search performance of MOEA/D in multi and many-objective optimization problems, in this work we propose the inverted PBI scalarizing approach which is an extension of the conventional PBI and WS. In this work, we analyze differences between inverted PBI and other scalarizing functions, and compare the search performances of NSGA-III and five MOEA/Ds using weighted Tchebycheff, reciprocal weighted Tchebycheff, WS, PBI and inverted PBI in many-objective knapsack problems and WFG4 problems with 2\UTF{2013}8 objectives. As results, we show that the inverted PBI based MOEA/D achieves higher search performance than other algorithms in problems with many-objectives and the difficulty to approximate a widely spread Pareto front in the objective space. Also, we show the robustness of the inverted PBI on Pareto front geometry by using problems with four representative concave, linear, convex and discontinuous Pareto fronts.},

	Abstract = {MOEA/D is one of the promising evolutionary algorithms for multi- and many-objective optimization. To improve the search performance of MOEA/D, this work focuses on the solution update method in the conventional MOEA/D and proposes its alternative, the chain-reaction solution update. The proposed method is designed to maintain and improve the variable (genetic) diversity in the population by avoiding duplication of solutions in the population. In addition, the proposed method determines the order of existing solutions to be updated depending on the location of each offspring in the objective space. Furthermore, when an existing solution in the population is replaced by a new offspring, the proposed method tries to reutilize the existing solution for other search directions by recursively performing the proposed chain-reaction update procedure. This work uses discrete knapsack and continuous WFG4 problems with 2\UTF{2013}8 objectives. Experimental results using knapsack problems show the proposed chain-reaction update contributes to improving the search performance of MOEA/D by enhancing the diversity of solutions in the objective space. In addition, experimental results using WFG4 problems show that the search performance of MOEA/D can be further improved using the proposed method.},

	Abstract = {Many-objective optimization refers to optimizing a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) where the number of objectives is more than 3. Most classical evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms use the Pareto dominance relation to guide the search, which usually perform poorly in the many-objective optimization scenario. This paper proposes an EMO algorithm based on information separation and neighbor punishment selection (ISNPS) to deal with many-objective optimization problems. ISNPS separates individual's behavior in the population into convergence information and distribution information by rotating the original coordinates in the objective space. Specifically, the proposed algorithm employs one coordinate to reflect individual's convergence and the remaining $$m-1$$m-1 coordinates to reflect individual's distribution, where m is the number of objectives in a given MOP. In addition, a neighborhood punishment strategy is developed to prevent individuals from being crowded. From a series of experiments on 42 test instances with 3\UTF{2013}10 objectives, ISNPS has been found to be very competitive against six representative algorithms in the EMO area.},

@article{Streichert2005Parallelization,
	Abstract = {While single-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) parallelization schemes are both well established and easy to implement, this is not the case for Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). Nevertheless, the need for parallelizing MOEAs arises in many real-world applications, where fitness evaluations and the optimization process can be very time consuming. In this paper, we test the `divide and conquer' approach to parallelize MOEAs, aimed at improving the speed of convergence beyond a parallel island MOEA with migration. We also suggest a clustering based parallelization scheme for MOEAs and compare it to several alternative MOEA parallelization schemes on multiple standard multi-objective test functions.},

@article{Wang2016Objective,
	Abstract = {It is hard to obtain the entire solution set of a many-objective optimization problem (MaOP) by multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) because of the difficulties brought by the large number of objectives. However, the redundancy of objectives exists in some problems with correlated objectives (linearly or nonlinearly). Objective reduction can be used to decrease the difficulties of some MaOPs. In this paper, we propose a novel objective reduction approach based on nonlinear correlation information entropy (NCIE). It uses the NCIE matrix to measure the linear and nonlinear correlation between objectives and a simple method to select the most conflicting objectives during the execution of MOEAs. We embed our approach into both Pareto-based and indicator-based MOEAs to analyze the impact of our reduction method on the performance of these algorithms. The results show that our approach significantly improves the performance of Pareto-based MOEAs on both reducible and irreducible MaOPs, but does not much help the performance of indicator-based MOEAs.},

@article{Zhou2015Ensemble,
	Abstract = {The performance of most existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms deteriorates severely in the face of many-objective problems. Many-objective optimization has been gaining increasing attention, and many new many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEA) have recently been proposed. On the one hand, solution sets with totally different characteristics are obtained by different MaOEAs, since different MaOEAs have different convergence-diversity tradeoff relations. This may suggest the potential usefulness of ensemble approaches of different MaOEAs. On the other hand, the performance of MaOEAs may vary greatly from one problem to another, so that choosing the most appropriate MaOEA is often a non-trivial task. Hence, an MaOEA that performs generally well on a set of problems is often desirable. This study proposes an ensemble of MaOEAs (EMaOEA) for many-objective problems. When solving a single problem, EMaOEA invests its computational budget to its constituent MaOEAs, runs them in parallel and maintains interactions between them by a simple information sharing scheme. Experimental results on 80 benchmark problems have shown that, by integrating the advantages of different MaOEAs into one framework, EMaOEA not only provides practitioners a unified framework for solving their problem set, but also may lead to better performance than a single MaOEA.},
